    <h1>Reflection:</h1>
    <p>The color and typography choice reflect my personal identity because they show my gentle and whimsical nature. Especially focusing on the yellow, green, and pink pastels, I think it adequately represents how optimistic I am. The dark blues are a good complement because I am also introverted and calm sometimes. The cursive font also emphasizes my spirited personality, and the body font provides a nice and clean contrast to it. The visual elements that feel the most authentic to me are the font and color palette, because I’ve also used this color palette for past projects that have been about me. I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about my decisions and slowly tweaking them (like choosing slightly different colors) to make sure I’m satisfied with everything I’ve chosen. <br><br>

The accessibility requirements that influence my design decisions were changing my color palette to make sure it passed the minimum contrast ratio. Before, if I wanted to combine two colors together to make a text block, it wouldn’t pass the ratio of 4.5:1. However, after running it through the checker, I changed the value of some of the colors to provide more contrast. Since the cursive font is also difficult to read in large amounts, I also decided to only make it for the header 1, while the rest of the headers are my “normal” font. A challenge I faced was wanting to keep my original color palette, even though it wasn’t too accessible. However, after much trial and error, I found a combination that I was satisfied with. <br><br>

Something that surprised me about creating a cohesive design was how much easier it got along the way. It got a little stressful at first when I was finalizing the colors and font styles since there were so many choices to make. However, it eventually got easier, like making the button, because I had already made the hard decisions. I had more limits on what I could choose, so it was less stressful for me. I will apply this system to my portfolio project by using the same fonts, color palettes, and interactive elements. I will probably tweak the font sizes and weights when everything comes together. <br><br>

I might expand or refine this system by choosing better or worthwhile links to the interactive elements and possibly making them fancier, mainly to have more contrast against the normal text. I might change how the border of the button looks or how the link appears. However, I intend to keep the general concept of both. I might also expand this system by exploring what I can do with the color palette, possibly by adding asides or other modules to make my organization more dynamic. Aspects that I feel least flexible in are using the cursive font and using the same color palette. Aspects that I feel are most flexible are changing how the interactive elements look and the hierarchy of the different headers.
