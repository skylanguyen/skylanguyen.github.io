        <h1>Hi, I'm Skyla!</h1>
        <p>I'm a sophomore at the University of Colorado Boulder. 
            I am currently completing a major in Creative Technology and Design and a minor in Information Science. 
            I am also obtaining a certificate in User Experience. I hope to develop my skills mainly as a 2D designer.

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>My name is Skyla Nguyen and I am based near Denver, CO. I am currently a photography assistant for CU Boulder's Anderson Language and Technology Center, where I 
            focus on coordinating and capturing events that our department hosts. I specialize in designing publication 
            layouts and photo editing, mainly with Adobe CC tools. I bring an empathetic and understanding perspective to 
            the design world, wanting all users to enjoy the projects I create. <br> <br>Feel free to connect with me 
            for any reasons!

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p> My main goal is to design technology that can be enjoyed and understood by various groups of people, regardless of 
            any disparities or barriers. Academically, I hope to develop my web development and 2D design skills during my 
            time here at the Atlas Institute. I also hope to connect with other industry professionals (and fellow designers!) 
            to help enrich my experience with design.
