    <p>The extensions I added to this “quote” generator are by adding an image generator API. I couldn’t find one that
      worked and was Christmas themed, so you get dogs! I also extended the machine by adding a light and dark mode
      toggle. It uses a combination of CSS, HTML, and JS because it also saves your preferences.
<br><br>
      I could imagine using an API in my critique project by also using an image generator to create a grid of
      “products.” I could also find specific APIs of Amazon products, listings, and reviews. As a result, when I
      critique or “fix” some features in my project, the website can somewhat resemble the actual Amazon website.
