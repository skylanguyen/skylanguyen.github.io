                    <p>For this project, I explored playing with font sizes, weights, and other features to illustrate the lyrics and mood of a chosen song. I tried to capture the same emotion while also limiting the intense use of graphic elements.</p>

                    <p>I redesigned the poster mailer for the Colorado Symphony. I played with different color palettes, font combinations, negative space, and other design fundamentals in order to print it in real time.</p>

            <p>With this project, I designed a personal logo first by playing with the "Sky" part in my first name. I then created an ice cream brand where I made digital mock ups of the final design.</p>
